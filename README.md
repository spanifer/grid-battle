<h1 align="center">Grid Battlefield (a battleships game)</h1>

The pencil and paper game implementation in a terminal application.

Battleships is a turn based, two player game, set in a indexed finite grid space. This app allow you to play against the computer.

As a child I played this game with my father with somewhat different setup, called Battleplanes. My ultimate goal is to have the well known Battleships game and the derived Battleplanes game mode implemented in the application.

## Design Process
<a href="#table-of-content">Go back <span style="font-size: 1.3em">üîù</span></a>

### Base Plan

-   #### User Stories
    1.  As a new user I want to get a general unambiguous read of the game rules.
    1.  As a user I want to be able to play a game, with clear responses of the game state.
    1.  As a user I want to review other players achieved top scores.

-   #### Application Aim
    -   To communicate the game course clearly.
    -   To give the option for the player to save an achieved high score.
    -   To allow the user to have an unambiguous, error free, gameplay experience.
-   #### Roadmap
    1.  *Menu* - main menu with multiple options
    1.  *Battleships game* - the main game implementation
    1.  *High scores* - stored in a local json
    1.  *Game rules* - description of
    1.  *Battleplanes game mode* - the special game
    1.  Testing

### Flowchart

To have an understanding of the required step for the application, I have created the following flowchart using draw.io.

![Flowchart](readme/diagrams/flowchart.drawio.svg)

### Data Model

Halfway through development I began to realize how to *think* to approach modeling data. The updated chart below shows most of the data model utilized.

![Data Model](readme/diagrams/data-model.drawio.svg)

### File Structure

I chose `src` as in 'source code' for the folder name where the python scripts exist.
I have separated class definitions as `/classes`.

### Found Bugs

During the development process I have encountered and produced several bugs and errors that required a solution. I have documented the causes and solutions here.

-   String delimiter error: `SyntaxError: f-string: expecting '}'`
    -   Intent:
        -   To center the computers game board. 
    -   Cause:
        -   I have used an f-string, and in the curly braces I had an expression including another string definition with the same single quote `'`. That breaks the formatted string literal.
    -   Solution:
        -   I have replaced one of the string delimiter with double quotes `"`

-   Recursion error
    -   Intent:
        -   Randomly place the ships on the board.
    -   Cause:
        -   The call stack exceeded after calling `Board.__validate_range()` from `Board.__find_ship_coords()` while the range test had a logic error of `and` instead of `or`.
    -   Solution:
        -   Swapped `and` with `or` 

-   EOFError while debugger encountered an input()
    -   Intent:
        -   VSCode debugger tool usage.
    -   Cause:
        -   The `launch.json` debug configuration file default setting on the `"console"` was `"integratedConsole"` which didn't allow (or as far as I could tell) to pass in input str. 
    -   Solution:
        -   Using VSCode IntelliSense suggestions (by pressing `Ctrl`+`Space`) I have found the `"integratedTerminal"` option, that eliminated the error and allow me to take advantage of the debugger.

-   TypeError while trying to unpack a tuple on one line
    -   Intent:
        -   To "save some time" and line of code, I have tried to unpack a tuple that is 1 indexed game coordinate, perform the subtraction on each number to convert it to 0 indexed and repack it in to a tuple in one line.
    -   Cause:
        -   Ultimately the following expression `[(x,y) for x,y in (int1,int2)]` raised `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable int object`. That is exactly as the error message states, as in `x,y = 1` case.
    -   Solution:
        -   While figuring out the issue, I have tried several solutions and none of them looked pleasing, and as I am just getting familiar with Python, while playing around in Python interpreter, I have stumbled upon generator expressions. For that, my personal goal to making this calculation a one liner concluded on `next(((x,y) for x,y in ((1,2),)))`. I understand this is really hard to read but as a personal discovery I intend to leave it in the final code, with a descriptive comment, unless I find a better solution.
        -   I have found a better solution...

## Deployment
<a href="#table-of-content">Go back <span style="font-size: 1.3em">üîù</span></a>

The project was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku.

-   Steps for deployment:
    -   Fork or clone this repository
    -   Create a new Heroku app
    -   In the app settings:
        -   Add a config var of `PORT`:`8000`
        -   Set the buildpacks to `Python` and `NodeJS` in that order
    -   Link the Heroku app to the forked repository
    -   Manually **Deploy**

### Making a Local Clone

> *Review* to make the whole project locally deployable

Requires Python 3 installed in local environment, to run the game in a terminal

-   Fork or clone this repository
-   Navigate to folder in a terminal
-   Run the following command `python3 run.py`
